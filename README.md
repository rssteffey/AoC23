# Advent of Code - 2023
## This time it's Elixir

I've never done Elixir before, so this felt like a good time to start

## Journal of Shawn's daily feelings on the matter

- Day 1 - Learning curve, but doable
- Day 2 - still incomplete as of this writing (though pretty confident I can get it now)
- Day 3 - I hate everything why didn't I just do this in Python and go enjoy the rest of my life.  (Although slight ray of hope when Star #2 was actually an easy shift due to the function piping)
- Day 4 - pattern matching on recursion suddenly clicked, and I am feeling GOOD. 20 minute first star, another hour for the second. Still no where near my JS/Php/C#/Basic-on-a-TI84 speeds, but I no longer feel like throwing my laptop
